Description: Clustering and classification inference for high dimension low sample size (HDLSS)
    data with U-statistics. The package contains implementations of nonparametric statistical
    tests for sample homogeneity, group separation, clustering, and classification of 
    multivariate data. The methods have high statistical power and are tailored for data
    in which the dimension L is much larger than sample size n. See Gabriela B. Cybis,
    Marcio Valk and SÃ­lvia RC Lopes (2018) <doi:10.1080/00949655.2017.1374387> and Marcio 
    Valk and Gabriela B. Cybis (2018) <arXiv:1805.12179>.
